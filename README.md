# Flavour Finder

Flavour Finder is a recipe sharing platform where users can sign up and login to allowing users to create, edit, update and delete recipes.

We had 10 days to make a working application which was both back-end and front-end and I worked with two other people (Luke and Jill).

## Deployment Link:

## Technologies Used ðŸ’¡

- HTML5
- Saas
- React.js
- Node.js
- Javascript
- Express
- Mongo and Mongoose
- Cloudinary
- Heroku

## Brief

- Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end
- Use an Express API to serve your data from a Mongo database
- Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React
- Be a complete product with multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models

## Planning

### Wireframe

We created a wireframe using figma as we knew we needed to have our ideas written down and decided on the colour scheme. Then we went onto creating our models, controllers as well as deciding on our components in the front end.

### Trello

We used Trello to organise everything that we needed to do for our project. We added a To Do, In Progress and Completed section as well as any stretch goals we wanted to implement after we completed our MVP's.

### Build Process

We all decided to work on parts of the backend and the frontend as we wanted experience on both. We divided up our tasks and each of us chose what we wanted to do. Firstly we started off on the backend, Luke and I decided to pair programme, I created the user and recipe controllers and he created the models, whilst Jill created the seed data using AI.

In the recipe controllers, I specifically created the index, show, create, update and delete routes.
